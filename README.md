###The **notes.md** above contains some of the key code snippets for the more important visualizations in this dataset breakdown.

The most telling visualizations in this dataset cover the peak delays in hours of the day and minute-delay average

The lowest in this chart are usually considered as dates with the lowest priced fares due to demand, leading to the expected lesser delays.

Here we can see the total minute average per airline throughout the seasons. Spring and Summer tend to be a strong suit for delays, especially for NK (Spirit Airlines).

Conclusions:

Peak hours for delays align with general rush hours.
Atlanta and Chicago airports have notably high delays.





History tends to repeat itself in this dataset, there's very little competition for the 4th and 5th place in terms of delays of any kind.
